gen_serial:recv/2 and gen_serial:recv/3 don't work.

These functions are not implemented yet in the native C driver, so
they can't supported in the Erlang code.  But they are spec'd in the
API.  I hope to have it in by 0.2 or 0.3.  Just keep the port in
{active, true} mode at all times and use the messages delivered to
get the data.
