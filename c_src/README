Windows Native Code:

To build the Windows native code, load the Visual C++ project file
in "win32/win32serial.vcproj".  Use Build Solution to compile the
project.  Two configurations are supported, "Release" and "Debug".

When the build is complete, a post build trigger should copy the
executeable "serial_esock.exe" from win32/Debug or win32/Release
to ../priv/bin, the directory where the gen_serial application will
expect to find the executable file.


UNIX Native Code:

Not ready at this time.  It cannot be built.  Look in 0.2 for the
UNIX version.
